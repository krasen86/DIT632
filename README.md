## Work package 1

[Here](./wp_1/) you can find the descriptions for the first work package exercises.

Exercise 1: Reads in an integer number between 1 and 5 from the keyboard and prints out one of existing five sentences on the console depending on what number was entered. 

Exercise 2: Count the number of words in a sentence.

Exercise 3: String encryption algorithm for ASCII characters shifting.

Exercise 4: Guess the number game with rand() function.

## Work package 2

[Here](./wp_2/) you can find the descriptions for the second work package exercises.

Exercise 1: Copy a given string, strcpy()

Exercise 2: Create and print a random integer array by use of pointers

Exercise 3: Compare two strings provided from the command line with strcmp() and without.

Exercise 4: Checks if the string is a palindrome.

Exercise 5: Creates a random array and calculates the frequency of the numbers and plots a histogram

Exercise 6: Creates a "que" with array[] and populates the que and has a input adn output method

Exercise 7: The programme checks if a given personal number is valid

Exercise 8: Nim game - Two players take in turn between one and three coins from the stack. Whoever are forced to take the last coin have lost. The program allows quitting at any step by inputting 'q'.

## Work package 3

[Here](./wp_3/) you can find the descriptions for the third work package exercises.

Exercise 1: Move robot in a given direction. Uses structure for robot and simulates movement on it.

Exercise 2: Sorts a given array with enhanced bubble sort and searches(linear) for a given number. -> readNumber(), inputValidationInteger()

Exercise 3: Double linked list containing integers, addFirst()

Exercise 4: File management(binary) with person structure and uses of header file for personal number( implementation contains getIntegerValue from a char). createFile(), writeToFile, readFromFile

## Work package 4

[Here](./wp_4/) you can find the descriptions for the fourth work package exercises.

Exercise 1: Encoding a given integers arguments to hexadecimal value by using bit manipulation. bit-shifting 

Exercise 2: Decode a given hexadecimal to their binary value and extract the bits from that value. strtol(base 16), int getBits(unsigned int value, int startPos, int numOfBits) -- hexadecimal

Exercise 3: Check if a given port-bit is pressed and print the value of the register.

Exercise 4: TinkerCad -- 8 LEDs that rotate clockwise, a switch that starts/stops the shifting of the LEDs, uses bit-shifting -- Pull-UP resistor

Exercise 5: TinkerCad -- Keypad printing the pressed key, columns input and rows set to output - PULL-UP

## Work package 5

[Here](./wp_5/) you can find the descriptions for the fifth work package exercises.

Exercise 1: TinkerCad -- Keypad printing the pressed key by using interrupt connected to a logical AND gate, columns input and rows set to output - PULL-UP

Exercise 2: TinkerCad -- Temperature sensor and Keypad. Analog reading for temperature sensor displaying the reading in Celsius. Printing the pressed key by using interrupt connected to a logical AND gate, columns input and rows set to output - PULL-UP, calculates temperature in celsius and delay interrupt
